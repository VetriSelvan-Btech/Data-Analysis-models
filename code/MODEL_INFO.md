## üîç Model Interpretability

### Risk Factors
The model identifies several key risk factors:
- **Month-to-month contracts**: Higher churn risk
- **Short tenure**: Less than 12 months
- **High monthly charges**: Over $100/month
- **Fiber optic service**: Higher churn rate than DSL
- **Electronic check payment**: Higher risk than automatic payments
- **No additional services**: Lack of security, backup, or tech support

### Protective Factors
- **Long-term contracts**: Two-year contracts have lowest churn
- **Long tenure**: Over 5 years with the company
