## ü§ñ Model Architecture

### Algorithm: CatBoost
CatBoost (Categorical Boosting) is an advanced gradient boosting algorithm that excels at handling categorical features directly without preprocessing.

#### Key Advantages:
- **Native Categorical Support**: Handles categorical variables without one-hot encoding
- **Reduced Overfitting**: Uses ordered boosting to prevent target leakage
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and accuracy
- **Feature Importance**: Provides detailed feature ranking

#### Mathematical Process:
1. **Gradient Boosting**: Builds trees sequentially, each correcting the previous tree's errors
2. **Categorical Encoding**: Uses target-based encoding for categorical features
3. **Regularization**: Applies L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
4. **Early Stopping**: Stops training when validation performance plateaus

## üéì Model Training Process

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- Loaded 7,043 customer records from IBM Watson Analytics
- Cleaned missing values and converted data types
- Handled categorical variables (gender, contract type, etc.)
- Converted target variable (Churn: Yes/No ‚Üí 1/0)

### Step 2: Feature Engineering
- Created tenure groups (New: 0-12, Short: 13-24, Medium: 25-48, Long: 49+ months)
- Grouped charges by ranges (Low, Medium, High, Very High)
- Added interaction features (contract type, payment method)
- Calculated service count composite features

### Step 3: Model Training
- Split data: 80% training, 20% testing with stratification
- Used CatBoost algorithm with optimized hyperparameters
- Applied class weights (3:1) to handle imbalanced data
- Implemented 5-fold cross-validation for robustness

### Step 4: Model Evaluation
- Evaluated using multiple metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
- Analyzed feature importance rankings
- Generated confusion matrix for error analysis
- Validated performance on unseen test data
